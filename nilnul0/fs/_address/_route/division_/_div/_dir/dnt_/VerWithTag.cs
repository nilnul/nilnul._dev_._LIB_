	/// when a dir is named like "2107misc",
	///		if the "2107misc" when taken as identy, is {nom:2107misc,ver:""}. but "2107misc" starts with digit, which contravenes our rule about nom(<see cref="nameof(nilnul.obj_.deV._id._nom._idiom._casible)"/>).
	///		so we may need to consider "2107misc" as the ver. but this contravenes out definition of ver (see <see cref="nameof(nilnul.txt_._versioned.IVersion)"/>).
	///			we now need to extend the definition of version to variant/versioner/revision. SemVer is a form of variant, but variant is more than semVer.
